Assignment Details:

Write a python program to build a sentence generator program using bi-gram and 
tri-gram model. You will generate M sentences by starting with random (n-1) gram 
from the model and then randomly select the next word until reaching a max length 
of sentence. The corpus used in this assignment is Brown Corpus in NLTK library.

Get all sentences from brown corpus.

Input:

• m -> Number of sentences to be generated

• n -> 2 for bigram – 3 for trigram

• maxLen -> Max number of words in sentence generated. Used as stopping 
condition in generating a sentence.

• Corpus -> list of sentences to generate n-gram model from it.
Output:

• m sentences each sentence contain maxLen words.

Steps:

1-Apply data preprocessing:

• Tokenize sentences into words (Word Tokenization).
• Remove punctuation marks from tokens.
• Convert all tokens to lowercase.

2-Build N-gram model:
Build n-gram dictionary, where the keys are tuples of n-1 words (n-1 gram) and the values are lists of 
possible next words.

3-Sentence Generator:
Sentence generation process start with a random n-1 gram from the model and then randomly select 
the next word until reaching maxLen or unable to find next word
